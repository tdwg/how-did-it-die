A proposal for the new vitality term and control vocabulary has been submitted to TDWG: https://github.com/tdwg/dwc/issues/363 and has been flagged as ready for public comment.

Most of the meeting was spent going through two use cases to see how our proposed vocabulary works against the examples.

Use cases: 
1. Causes of Death from the UK Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme (PBMS)
From Lee A. Walker of the UK's Centre of Ecology and Hydrology.

2. FMNH Amphibians and Reptiles Collection Database

The vocabulary terms and proposed definitions are here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sa56LxDyaxJwKRqw7cimoLb9RWCWYEQHjDkZ-WfHnxo/edit?usp=sharing

The TG will have a working group session at the TWDG conference in November and also a slot in the IG session. A slide has been added of the TG hilghlights for the TDWG2021 Business Meeting.

## Actions ##
1. Please ask colleages to comment on the proposal for vitality, to raise awareness and agreement for it.
2. Suggest other use cases to test the causes of death vocabulary, we could go through them in the working session in November 2021.
