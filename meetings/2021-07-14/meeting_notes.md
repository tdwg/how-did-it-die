## 2021-07-14 Progress meeting ##

- Agreed the final terms and definitions for the `vitality` term:

| Term  | Definition |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| dead  | The state where the organism has irreversible loss of functional metabolism  |
| alive  | The state where the organism has functional metabolism  |
| dead  | The functional metabolism of the organism is not possible to determine  |
| alive  | The vitality of the organism was not recorded at the time the observation or collection was made  |

- Add OBIS and The Field Museum (for the [Digitization TCN: Collaborative Research: Mobilizing Millions of Marine Mollusks of the Eastern Seaboard](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2001536&HistoricalAwards=false)) as supporting organisations and contact iNaturalist to see whether we could include them.

- Agreed that the `vitality` term proposal is ready to submit, see: [Vitality proposal](https://github.com/tdwg/how-did-it-die/blob/main/proposal/vitality.md/), once supporting organisations are organised.


### cause of death extension ###

- Recommend using the [Geological context](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#geologicalcontext) Darwin Core terms for date of death in the case of prehistoric records

- Agreed `deathDateNotes` which could be used when the date of death is not known

- continue to develop the `causeofDeath` vocabulary. Agreed to classify the terms at a higher level, the consenus was that it would be more beneficial to have a coarser vocabulary than too details. Suggestions for the higher level classification:

--Natural - environmental
--Natural - biotic
--Anthropogenic
--Unknown



### Actions ###

- submit the proposal for the addition of vitality to core Darwin Core, using the form: https://github.com/tdwg/dwc/issues/
- continue to add terms to the `causeofDeath` vocabulary and classification
