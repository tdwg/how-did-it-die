* Agreement that we would propose the addition of a single term `vitality` to DwC core and an extension for the additional terms.

* `vitality`
requires an additional term other than `unknown`, for example `presumed dead` or `unable to determine`. 

* Should there be an option for `dormant` or could `unable to determine` cover it?

* We need definitions for the terms dead and alive. Should we use an existing definition: http://www.ontobee.org/search?ontology=&submit=Search+terms&keywords=alive

* `causesOfDeath`
Agreement that we should propose a controlled vocabulary for causesOfDeath.

* `underlyingCausesOfDeath`
Agreement to change this term to free text rather than require a controlled vocabulary

* `deathDate`
How do we record unknown? Is unknown permitted in a date term? Would a free text field `deathDateNotes` help? Agreed that time since death to indicate decay rate is out of scope

### Actions ###
1. raise a new issue to propose that `vitality` is added to the core, using the form here: https://github.com/tdwg/dwc/issues/

2. write a short paper for the BIS journal describing the use cases and justifications for an extension for remaining terms
3. the team should continue to add use cases and vocabulary for `causesOfDeath`
4. recommend addition of `preservationDate` for `MaterialSamples`
5. follow up meeting in a months time (July 2021)
