The main discussion was on the feedback to consider using the term and controlled vocabulary from PATO for the vitality term.

There was concern about using the term physiological because it was too broad a term than what we are trying to describe. The definitions for dead and alive in PATO refer to viability, which is a name that the group had previously discounted becauase it reflects more the ability of an organism to live rather than it's state as either alive or dead. The group also felt that the definition in PATO is not very clear (e.g. A viability quality inhering in a bearer by virtue of the cessation of the bearer's life.)

We had a poll with the following options for the name of the term:
1. vitality
2. viability
3. physiological state

The poll results were:

vitality 5  
viability 1 
physiological state 3

It was agreed to continue with vitality as the term name and to add the term 'mixed' to indicate collection lots of both live and dead organisms.

The remainder of the session was spent reviewing the terms for the proposed cause of death extension.

SR (session convenor) agreed to find one more use case for the cause of death vocabulary - ideally for mammals and then finish off the proposal document for the extension.
