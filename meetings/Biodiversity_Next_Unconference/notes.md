## Vitality & CauseOfDeath ##

### Introduction ###
Linked to the...

    decay process
    health
    taphonomy
    species interactions (disease, pests, predators)

Relates to dwc:basisOfRecord

    PreservedSpecimen
    FossilSpecimen
    HumanObservation
    LivingSpecimen

### Use Cases ###

    Disease Ecology
    Causes of death in a living collection (animals and plants)
    Historical studies
    The last specimen of an extinct taxon
    Understanding the genomics of dead organisms (e.g. non-target organisms)
    Communication with the public about the origins of collections
    identifying roadkill hotspots
    Documenting whale strandings
    Studying the phenology of death
    Quantifying by-catch in invasive species control programs
    Reducing unnecessary mortality of endangered species.

### Scope ###

    When did it die? (also see dwc:GeologicalContext)
    Collection methods (dwc:samplingProtocol)
    Should close to death be included?
    Uncertainty
    "Natural" versus "unnatural" death
    Multiple causes of death e.g. killed on road as a cause of blindness caused by disease.

Consider the public sensitivity towards death and killing animals.
