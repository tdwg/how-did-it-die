## Use Cases ##
4 uses cases : Fossil, Found dead, Sensors says its dead, just Killed 

1. Fossil : estimate >> estimate in years
2. Found dead: remains could give cuses for the date >> estimate  in days
3. Sensors: the sensors “accelerometer” or “GPS” is not giving signal
4. Killed : I have seen it happened >> exact date
    
    
## Vitality ##
Vitality >> not Life stage >> Status >> Stage 
Value: Alive, dead, unknown


### Do we need date of death? ###
deathDate: a date field, can be a range. Should take ISO
    Use case 1: 2020-03-16
    Use case 2: 2020-05-17/2020-05-21
        We saw the thing alive on the 17th may, then dead on the 21st may
Aaaaa: estimation of the time/date of death 

Use case: we find a dead animal that, from the decomposition, we estimate it’s been dead 1week.
With that “definition”, it could not take a controlled vocab
Need to be a mandatory field? Would you need to state date of жdeath is unknown, estimate, or exact? 
It would useful to have this identified for the future practice and use of the term. Ultimately, yes would want date of death and definition should be specified as much as possible. An additional tag would be important to include -->Maybe have a general term (exact, estimate, or unknown) for easy future search/use of pulling data. 
How would this apply to fossils?
Include time period estimates
Date of capture vs. Date of Death
Time from death to preservation estimate

## Cause of death ##
Specify details for cause of death (live capture vs. found dead)
Should the term be defined according to different groups, eg animals, plants, fungi?
How about predator gut remains, are they also considered in the 'dead' term
