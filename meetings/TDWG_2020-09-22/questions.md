In general I am not thrilled about the use of the term ‘unknown’ as it is very confusing and will easily become crammed with lots of stuff.  That said, unknown might be the best term for vitality of spores, etc.
In the discussion of the vitality field I do like ‘evidence’ or something similar.  This would suit observations of tracks, scat, feathers, molts, etc. These are circumstantial evidence of ‘life’.
If the observation is of a seashell does it follow that the individual is dead? are there examples of gastropods/organisms that cast off old shells??? (as opposed to crabs molting their carapaces).
If vitality is dead or alive then OccurrenceStatus must be ‘present’, correct?
If vitality is ‘evidence’ then is OccurrenceStatus ‘present’??? (not at the time that the observation was recorded)
Is ‘dead’ better suited to Animalia? When are plants considered ‘dead’.
Should ‘dead’ be associated with lifestage? Should spores be tagged dead/alive?  Maybe this is an example of when ‘unknown’ would be appropriate.
